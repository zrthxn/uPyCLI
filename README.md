# uPyCLI

A microscopic library to turn any function into a CLI.

Takes some inspiration from [pycli](https://github.com/garenchan/pycli) although I didn't know 
this existed before starting. This lib is even smaller than `pycli` and does not require any setup 
and has no dependencies.

## Usage

```bash
cli path.to.your.function --help
```
